## Technology

I made this project primarily as a vehicle for learning React Native, but also because I considered the UI of existing live poker tracking apps to be ugly and outdated.  With that in mind, I focused on creating a simple and attractive user interface and included a dynamic graph, as seen in state of the art financial apps such as Monzo.  The key technologies used were:

- React Native
- Redux
- Firebase
- d3.js
